            <span className={styles.label}>Quality Beef:</span> The heart of a
            perfect burger is top-notch beef. Opt for fresh, high-quality ground
            beef with a fat content of about 20% for the juiciest, most
            flavorful results.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className={styles.label}>Seasoning:</span> Simplicity is key
            here. A generous pinch of salt and black pepper just before cooking
            will enhance the beef's natural flavors without overshadowing them.
            Don't Overwork the Meat: When forming your patties, be gentle.
            Overworking the meat can lead to dense, tough burgers. You want a
            patty that's firm enough to hold together, but not compressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className={styles.label}>Cooking:</span> High heat is crucial.
            Whether you're grilling or pan-searing, make sure your cooking
            surface is hot enough to form a nice crust on the patty, sealing in
            those delicious juices.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className={styles.label}>Resting:</span> Allow your cooked
            burgers to rest for a few minutes before serving. This lets the
            juices redistribute throughout the patty, ensuring a moist and
            flavorful bite.
